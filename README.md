#Chilean Seism wrapper.

##Description.

This python app, uses Beautiful soup to make web scrapping to 
the official page for chilean seisms, http://sismologia.cl/
the National Seismological Center, (CSN acronym in spanish).

This tool will grabb the recent seisms that happened in Chile
from 3.3 Mw in the Richter Scale and up.

Disclaimer: This too is 100% made by @Technopy311, 
and is not official of the CSN.

Pd: I love THM (tryhackme.com) not sponsored or anything.

##Installation:
1- Make sure you have python3 installed in your machine.
2- Install all the libraries included in the the "requirements.txt" text file
by doing "python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt" or "pip3 install -r requirements.txt".

Note: If you are using linux, you may need to install the "pip" package for python3:
In debian based distros, (Ubuntu, Kali, Parrot, Raspbian,etc...)
you need to do on a terminal: "sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip"
it will ask for your password and then it will install the pip. Then come back to step 2.

3- After all the installation of the libraries is done, then you only need to do:
In a terminal (linux) "python3 ./main.py" 

In windows: 
- Open a console (press windows key and type cmd, then hit enter).
- then type: "python3 .\main.py" 
sometimes it doesn't recognize the "python" command so just try using "python".
